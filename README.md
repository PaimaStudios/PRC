# Paima Request for Comments (PRC)

=======
PRCs are a way to formulate standards for Paima - notably around a common set of endpoints games expose to easily power composability, reusability and best-practices arund the Paima ecosystem

As concrete examples of what these standards can help achieve:
- the construction of an ecosystem around Paima (ex: create an achievement platform knowing all games will expose data in the same format)
- the standard contracts have to follow to be compatible with certain entries in the [Primitive Catalogue](https://docs.paimastudios.com/home/react-to-events/primitive-catalogue/introduction)
- Proposals to improve to Paima Engine itself
- Anything else that requires discussion and coordination of multiple parties
